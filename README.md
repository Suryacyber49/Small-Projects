# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Toolkit – Python Based

This repository is a beginner-friendly cybersecurity toolkit built using Python, combining two essential utilities:

- 🔐 SSH Brute Force Tool
- 🔒 SHA-256 Hash Generator

Designed for educational purposes, these tools are intended to help you understand core concepts like brute-force vulnerabilities and cryptographic hashing.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This toolkit is for **educational and ethical use only**. Do not run these scripts on systems or networks you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

This project consists of two simple but powerful Python scripts:

### 🔐 SSH Brute Force
A tool that demonstrates brute-force attacks on SSH servers using a username and a list of potential passwords. It highlights how weak SSH credentials can compromise a system.

### 🔒 SHA-256 Hash Generator
A quick Python script that generates a SHA-256 hash from any input string, showcasing how hashing works in data integrity and security.
